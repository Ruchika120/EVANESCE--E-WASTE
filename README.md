# EVANESCE--E-WASTE

Purpose:
The e-waste management system is now an online e-waste management website. Public
will get the information about the e-waste material and aware others about it. We will
collect the e-waste equipments from the sellers and it will be delivered to recycling
companies with the help of agents.

The Evanesce –E Waste is an application that allows users to sell various types of electronic
Waste. Once the seller have given all the information, then admin will verify it and will allow
or refuse the product. After request approval admin will send an agent to receive those
products and the details of agent will be shared with the end-user. It provides facilities for
adding, deleting, updating product request. For all this a lot of API’s is used for the ease of user. API allows two applications to talk to
each other and then the application interprets that data and presents the user with the
information the user wanted in a readable way. For the login of users into this website we use the user email authentication, which allows
users to sign up with their email. This platform is based on REST services and it tends to
independency of all services. This platform is rapid and frequent due to this technique
